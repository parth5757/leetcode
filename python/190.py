# Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

# Note:

# Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
# In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.


# Example 1:

# Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
# Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
# Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
# Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
# Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.


# Constraints:

# The input must be a binary string of length 32


# Function calculates the decimal equivalent
# to given binary number
